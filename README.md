In India's urban and peri-urban regions, greywater (GW) treatment and recycling have become 
essential strategies to alleviate water constraint. Due to the dense population, little rainfall, and extreme 
groundwater resource depletion, these areas face significant challenges. 
Over 50% of short-term water shortages may be avoided by recycling grey water, which 
includes wastewater from laundry, dishwashers, bathrooms, and kitchens. Effective treatment methods 
are crucial since the majority of the contaminants in greywater come from domestic activities and 
detergents.  
Significant obstacles still exist, nevertheless, in terms of public acceptance and the need for 
effective purifying techniques. Grey water biological treatment is particularly complex because of the 
presence of xenobiotics, surfactants, and different pollutant concentrations.  
Water consumption has grown due to globalization and rapid industrial expansion, making 
wastewater recycling technology increasingly important. Greywater is simpler to treat using filtering 
techniques such sand filtration, electrocoagulation (EC), activated carbon, and sediment paper since it 
has a lower organic content and biological oxygen demand (BOD).  
After treatment, the water can be safely used again for household gardening, toilet flushing, 
and agricultural irrigation. Greywater reuse shows promise as a sustainable approach to water 
management and conservation as the world's water demand continues to rise and natural resources 
becomes more limited.
